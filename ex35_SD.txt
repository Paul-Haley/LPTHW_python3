STUDY DRILL 2: Best you can do is diff with my attempt of typing it or copy 
and paste from the textbook into a file and do a diff with that file.

STUDY DRILL 3: Try commenting yourself first, best learning experience. I have
commented my version if that helps.

STUDY DRILL 4: A simple way of expanding it would be to add another door.

STUDY DRILL 5: I will work backwards with the questions they ask. int() tries 
(key word) to convert the string given to an integer, if it cannot it throws 
an 'error'. The only testing we do for if it is an error is by seeing if there 
is a '0' or '1' in the string. For example if you give the following input it 
breaks as shown below:

This room is full of gold. How much do you take?
> 1win
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex35.py", line 73, in <module>
    start()
  File "ex35.py", line 67, in start
    bear_room()
  File "ex35.py", line 37, in bear_room
    gold_room()
  File "ex35.py", line 8, in gold_room
    how_much = int(choice)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1win'

A better way to write it would be to look for this error. If the error occurs, 
ask for the number again. Error (exception) handling is likely covered later 
(I have not read the whole book yet), if it is not though, I would highly 
recommend looking it up.
