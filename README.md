# LPTHW_python3
Learn Python the Hard Way solutions done in Python 3 instead of Python 2 as per the book. Study Drill solutions are also included with changes made highlighted and commented out; some later ones due to increasing complexity are done in copied files with the changes and additional commenting. 

 The book can be found at:
https://learncodethehardway.org/python/

If there is any mistakes, plese alert me; all solutions were hand typed.
