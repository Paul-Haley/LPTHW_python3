I have not personally made any large/ real world Python 3 (or any Python) 
program before. Best thing to do would be to just search through GitHub or if 
you know of some existing code, look it up.

The LIBSVM repository has some Python code located here:
https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/tree/master/python

The Java implementation is utilised in my other repository:
https://github.com/Paul-Haley/svm_gui
