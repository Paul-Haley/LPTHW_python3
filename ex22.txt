print()
    Used to print strings. These strings can be formatted with various formatters after a % symbol.
    %
        Formatter for strings
    %d
        Formatter for integers
    %r
        String representation (debugging)
    %s
        String representation
input()
    Can take a string and will return the stdin (user input)
open()
    Opens the file specified and returns a file (file pointer).
    'r'
        Adding this to the open(file, 'r') will open the file in read mode,
        this is the default mode.
    'w'
        This will open the file in write mode, truncating all current contents
truncate()
    Truncates all the contents from the file specified
read()
    Reads the entire file contents and returns it
readline()
    Reads the current line of the file
seek()
    Seeks the index into the file (location in file) to the index given
write()
    Writes the specified string to the file at the current location

OPERATORS:
=
    Assign a value to a variable
+
    Addition
+=
    Add value to the current variables value and store it in the variable
-
    Subtractions
*
    Multiplication
    or allowing any number of arguments (recall *argv)
/
    integer division. Example: 3/4 = 0, 5/4 = 1
//
    float division. Example: 3//4 = 0.75
,
    Used to seperate arguments
#
    Used to start a comment
"text"
    " is used to make a String
'text'
    ' is also used to make a String

def name():
