You will need to install Python 3 typically no matter what system you have.
To check if you have a Python installation, go to your command prompt 
(Powershell for Windows, terminal (bash) for OSX or Linux) and type python.
If it returns a version number of 2 when it starts, type `exit()` and try 
typing python3. If the latter does not exist or both say they don't exist, you
will need to install Python 3. The easiest way would be to search the Python 
website (https://www.python.org/). The installion is pretty straight forward.

Text editor wise, Atom is pretty good for a first one. I use vim for Python and
C, but, use Eclipse for Java. It is best to not use a IDE (don't worrry if you 
do not worry what this means) when learning a language as you become dependent 
on it.

Make sure to have done the command line exercises before doing any other Python
exercises. Even if you only came to learn Python, you will learn more about 
programming works and why we have programming languages like Python. Command 
line skills are also essential to any Software Engineering employment.

I am happy to communicate if you are having troubles setting up.
